The central bank of Peru held its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.5% in its June meeting, signaling a data-dependent approach for any future adjustments. The decision was based on recent inflation data, which showed a slight monthly decline of 0.06% in May due to lower food prices, while core inflation rose just 0.05%. Annual headline inflation remained at 1.7%, and core inflation eased slightly to 1.8%, both near the center of the central bank’s target range. Inflation expectations over the next 12 months held steady at 2.3%, remaining within the target band. While economic activity indicators weakened slightly in May, most remained in optimistic territory, with output hovering around its potential level. The central bank also noted rising global trade tensions and financial market volatility as risks to the global economic outlook, which could impact inflation convergence.

Peru’s Cuts Rate to 4.5%
The central bank of Peru lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% during its May 2025 meeting, ending a three-month pause in rate adjustments. The move brings the policy rate closer to its estimated neutral level, with future changes dependent on evolving inflation dynamics and economic data. In April, headline inflation rose 0.32% month-over-month, while core inflation—excluding food and energy—came in at 0.14%. Annual inflation increased to 1.7%, up from 1.3% in March, largely driven by food prices, although core inflation remained stable at 1.9%, consistent with the bank’s target range. Inflation expectations over the next 12 months held steady at 2.3%, also within the target band. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) acknowledged a slight weakening in both current and expected economic activity indicators, but noted they remained generally optimistic, signaling that the economy is likely operating near its potential.

Peru Maintains Interest Rate at 4.75%
Peru’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 4.75% in April 2025, marking the third consecutive month without a change. Policymakers emphasized that any future adjustments will be guided by incoming data on inflation and its underlying drivers. In March, headline inflation eased to 1.3%, while core inflation fell to 1.9%, aligning closely with the midpoint of the central bank’s target range. Although domestic economic indicators pointed to a gradual recovery, global outlooks have deteriorated amid rising trade tensions—particularly in the United States—fueling uncertainty and market volatility. Against this backdrop, the BCRP reiterated its commitment to maintaining price stability and signaled a data-dependent approach moving forward. It also established specific rates for local currency operations, including a 2.75% annual rate for overnight deposits.
