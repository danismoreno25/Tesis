Paraguay’s annual inflation rate rose to 4.0% in June 2025 from 3.6% in May, ending a two-month easing trend.

Notable drops were seen in fruits (-7.2%), vegetables (-3.8%), and meats (beef and pork both -1.3%), along with some imported durables. In services and housing, monthly inflation was 0.1%, down from 0.2% a year earlier. Domestically produced goods saw monthly deflation of 0.3%, less than the -0.6% in June 2024.
