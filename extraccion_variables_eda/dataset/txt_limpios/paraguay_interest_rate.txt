Paraguay Holds Interest Rate Steady at 6%
The Central Bank of Paraguay kept its monetary policy rate at 6.0% per year during its April 2025 meeting. International oil prices decreased due to expectations of lower global demand and more favorable supply, and agricultural commodity prices showed volatility, with soybean and corn prices rising while wheat prices fell. Locally, Paraguay’s Monthly Economic Activity Indicator grew by 4.9% year-on-year in February (6.0% excluding agriculture and binational), driven by strong performances in services, manufacturing, electricity generation, livestock and construction, though agriculture moderated growth.
