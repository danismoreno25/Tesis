Brazil’s annual inflation rate slowed to 5.32% in May 2025 from 5.53% in April, the lowest in three months but still above the Central Bank’s 4.5% upper target for the seventh straight month. Price growth eased for food and non-alcoholic beverages (7.33% vs 7.81%), driven by sharp deflation in tubers, roots, and vegetables (-26.08%) and cereals, legumes, and oilseeds (-12.43%). Inflation also slowed for clothing (3.92% vs 4.01%) and transportation (4.64% vs 5.49%). However, prices accelerated for housing and utilities (4.53% vs 4%) and household goods and repairs (2.77% vs 2.49%). On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.26%, down from April’s 0.43% increase.
