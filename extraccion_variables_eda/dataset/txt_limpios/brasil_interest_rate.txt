The Central Bank of Brazil hiked its Selic rate by 25bps to 15% at its June meeting, citing persistent inflation and unanchored expectations. The Board highlighted a highly uncertain external environment, driven by US trade and fiscal policies and volatile global financial markets, which continue to weigh on emerging economies. Domestically, while economic activity and the labor market remain resilient, recent data show headline and core inflation above target, with expectations for 2025 and 2026 also exceeding the goal. Copom’s projection for 2026 inflation stands at 3.6%, reflecting ongoing inflationary risks, including strong services inflation, policy-driven exchange rate pressures, and unanchored long-term expectations. The committee signaled this may be the last hike in the current cycle, pending a reassessment of the lagging effects of past tightening. However, Copom emphasized its readiness to adjust policy further if inflation does not converge toward target.

Brazil Central Bank Raises Rate to 15%, Signals Possible Pause

Brazil Raises Rate by 50 bps
The Central Bank of Brazil raised its Selic rate by 50bps to 14.75% in May 2025, aiming to bring inflation closer to the target. While its primary goal is price stability, the decision also seeks to reduce economic fluctuations and support full employment. Economic activity and labor market indicators continue to show dynamism, though growth is moderating and both headline and underlying inflation remain above target. Market inflation forecasts for 2025 and 2026, as determined by the Focus survey, remain above the target at 5.5% and 4.5%, respectively, while Copom’s inflation projection for 2026 stands at 3.6% in the reference scenario. The Committee remains cautious and ready to adjust its policy as conditions evolve. The external environment remains adverse and particularly uncertain, especially due to US trade policy, which is fueling concerns about the magnitude of the global economic slowdown, heterogeneous effects on inflation and conduct of monetary policy.

Brazil's Central Bank Hikes Selic by 100 bps to 14.25%
The Central Bank of Brazil raised its Selic rate by 100 bps to 14.25% in March 2025, aiming to bring inflation closer to the target. While its primary goal is price stability, the decision also seeks to reduce economic fluctuations and support full employment. The external environment remains challenging, particularly due to uncertainty over US trade policy, which has raised concerns about economic slowdown, disinflation, and the Fed's stance.

Domestically, economic and labor market indicators show dynamism, though growth is moderating. Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 have risen significantly to 5.7% and 4.5%, respectively. The Committee remains cautious and ready to adjust its policy as conditions evolve.
