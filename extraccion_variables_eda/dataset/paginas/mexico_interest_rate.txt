The Bank of Mexico lowered its key rate by 50 bps to 8.00% on June 26th, as annual inflation increased to 4.51% by mid-June and the domestic economy expanded moderately in April, though slack persists. The release indicated that the Board could continue calibrating similar 50 bps cuts, anticipating that the disinflation process will allow a further easing cycle while maintaining a restrictive stance. However, the central bank remains cautious amid elevated global uncertainty—ranging from trade tensions to geopolitical conflicts—that could reignite inflation via peso depreciation or deepen the economic slowdown. While progress toward the 3% inflation target is on track, with forecasts pointing to convergence by the third quarter of 2026, members underscored the importance of a flexible policy framework to manage inflation expectations and preserve financial stability, particularly given the peso’s recent appreciation.

Mexico Interest Rate
In Mexico, interest rate decisions are taken by the Bank of Mexico (Banco de México). Starting January of 2008, Banco de México has adopted as an operating target the overnight interbank rate (tasa de fondeo bancario) instead of the level of commercial banks’ current account balances at the central bank (corto).

Banxico Cuts Interest Rate to 8%, as Expected

Banxico Lowers Interest Rate by 50bps, as Expected
The Bank of Mexico lowered its key rate by 50 bps to 8.50% on May 15th, as annual inflation eased to 3.93% in April and the domestic economy registered a modest 0.2% quarter-on-quarter expansion after earlier weakness. The release indicated that the Board could continue calibrating similar 50 bps cuts, anticipating that the disinflation process will allow a further easing cycle while maintaining a restrictive stance. However, the central bank remains cautious amid elevated global uncertainty—ranging from US trade tensions to geopolitical conflicts—that could either reignite inflation via peso depreciation or deepen the economic slowdown. While progress towards the 3% inflation target is on track, with forecasts pointing to convergence by the third quarter of 2026, members underscored the importance of a flexible policy framework to manage inflation expectations and preserve financial stability, particularly given the peso’s recent appreciation.

Banxico Cuts Rate to 9.0%, Signals Further Easing
Banxico, as the Mexican central bank is known, lowered its key rate by half a percentage point to 9.00% in a decision announced on March 27, as inflation eased further and amid signs of continued economic weakness early this year. The release revealed that several board members now foresee a similar 50bps reduction at the May 9 meeting if disinflation persists, signaling a potential continuation of the easing cycle. However, the central bank remains cautious amid significant global uncertainties, notably escalating trade tensions and broader geopolitical risks that could either fuel inflation through currency depreciation or dampen growth due to increased economic slack. While progress towards the 3% inflation target has been notable, members stressed the importance of a flexible policy framework, one that allows for gradual adjustments in a "new stage" of monetary policy without jeopardizing financial stability, particularly given the current rate differential with the US Fed.
