The Central Bank of Chile unanimously decided to keep the monetary policy rate steady at 5% at its June 2025 meeting. The decision came amid a complex global environment marked by persistent trade tensions, slowing US growth, and heightened geopolitical risks from the Middle East conflict. While financial markets have somewhat stabilized and copper prices have risen, oil prices surged following the recent escalation of war. Domestically, first-quarter economic activity exceeded expectations, driven by exports and resilient services, though the labor market remains weak with slow job creation and rising unemployment. Inflation has moderated, with headline and core CPI easing to 4.4% and 3.6% in May, and medium-term expectations anchored at 3%. The central bank noted that despite easing risks, global uncertainty may still disrupt inflation convergence. Looking ahead, policymakers signaled that if projections hold, the rate may gradually return to neutral range in the coming quarters.

Chile Keeps Interest Rate on Hold
The Central Bank of Chile unanimously decided to keep the monetary policy rate steady at 5% at its June 2025 meeting. The decision came amid a complex global environment marked by persistent trade tensions, slowing US growth, and heightened geopolitical risks from the Middle East conflict. While financial markets have somewhat stabilized and copper prices have risen, oil prices surged following the recent escalation of war. Domestically, first-quarter economic activity exceeded expectations, driven by exports and resilient services, though the labor market remains weak with slow job creation and rising unemployment. Inflation has moderated, with headline and core CPI easing to 4.4% and 3.6% in May, and medium-term expectations anchored at 3%. The central bank noted that despite easing risks, global uncertainty may still disrupt inflation convergence. Looking ahead, policymakers signaled that if projections hold, the rate may gradually return to neutral range in the coming quarters.

Chile Holds Interest Rate at 5%
The Central Bank of Chile unanimously kept its monetary policy interest rate unchanged at 5% during its April meeting, marking the fourth consecutive hold. The decision reflects heightened global uncertainty, particularly after the US announced new tariffs in early April, which have weighed on growth and inflation expectations. Global financial markets have seen increased volatility, with long-term US interest rates rising sharply and stock markets and currencies experiencing mixed movements. Despite this, Chile’s local financial conditions have improved, with declines in interest rates, a stronger peso, and gains in the stock market. Economic activity is gradually recovering, supported by export-related sectors and improving domestic demand. In March, headline inflation stood at 4.9%, while core inflation eased to 3.7%. The Central Bank reiterated its cautious and flexible approach to monetary policy, aiming to guide inflation toward its 3% target over the next two years.

Chile Leaves Interest Rate at 5%
The Central Bank of Chile unanimously decided to keep the policy interest rate at 5% at its March meeting. The Board mentioned that global economic uncertainty has risen since the last meeting due to escalating geopolitical risks and new US tariff announcements, along with responses from affected countries. This has particularly impacted U.S. growth prospects and raised inflation expectations, leading the Federal Reserve to pause its rate-cutting cycle. Global financial markets have reacted differently, with U.S. equities declining while European and Chinese stocks have risen. The weakening U.S. dollar has boosted commodity prices, with copper rising 8% since the last meeting, while oil prices have dropped around 9% due to global growth concerns. In Chile, financial markets have followed broader emerging-market trends, with lower interest rates, a 7% appreciation of the peso, and a 6% gain in the IPSA index.
