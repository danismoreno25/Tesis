Paraguay’s annual inflation rate rose to 4.0% in June 2025 from 3.6% in May, ending a two-month easing trend. The increase was driven by higher prices for fuels (+3.7%), clothing (+0.5%), and certain services, while declines in food products (-5.3%) helped offset broader gains. Notable drops were seen in fruits (-7.2%), vegetables (-3.8%), and meats (beef and pork both -1.3%), along with some imported durables. In services and housing, monthly inflation was 0.1%, down from 0.2% a year earlier. Domestically produced goods saw monthly deflation of 0.3%, less than the -0.6% in June 2024. Imported goods inflation (excluding fresh produce) rose 0.9%, up from 0.3% a year ago. On the month, overall inflation was flat (0.0%) versus +0.4% in May. Year-to-date inflation reached 3.0%, slightly above 2.8% in the same period of 2024.
