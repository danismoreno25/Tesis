Argentina’s central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by 300bps to 29% on January 31, 2025, as inflation continued to moderate. This was the ninth rate reduction since President Javier Milei took office in December 2023, bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level since October 2020. In December 2024, the annual inflation in the country slowed for the eighth consecutive month to 117.8%, the lowest level since July 2023, down from 166% in November. Monthly, inflation rate was at 2.7%, marking the third consecutive month below 3%. The rate cut coincides with the government's plan to reduce the currency's official monthly depreciation rate from 2% to 1% starting February 1. This contentious policy, known locally as the "crawling peg," has drawn considerable attention as policymakers seek to further ease inflation.

Argentina Overnight Repo Rate
In Argentina, Money Market Rate decisions are taken by The Central Bank of Argentina (Banco Central de la República Argentina, BCRA). Through December 31, 2016, the interest rate used for monetary policy was BCRA bills (LEBAC). From January 2, 2017 until a change in 2018, it was the median of the repo corridor. As of August 8, 2018, the monetary policy reference rate was the 7-day Liquidity bills rate (LELIQ). Since April 2019, the Bank started setting the floor rate for LELIQ. Starting January 21, 2021, the BCRA offers LELIQs for 7 and 14-day periods. As of January 6, 2022, the interest rate used for monetary policy, changed to LELIQs 28-day period. Following the central bank's new leadership formed by President Javier Milei in 2023, the central bank assumed the rate on overnight repo contracts as the country's official benchmark policy rate.

Argentina Cuts Interest Rate by 300bps to 29%
Argentina’s central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by 300bps to 29% on January 31, 2025, as inflation continued to moderate. This was the ninth rate reduction since President Javier Milei took office in December 2023, bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level since October 2020. In December 2024, the annual inflation in the country slowed for the eighth consecutive month to 117.8%, the lowest level since July 2023, down from 166% in November.

Argentina Keeps Key Interest Rate at 32%
Argentina’s central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 32% on January 16th,2025, following a 300bps reduction in early December. The decision comes after December’s annual inflation slowdown and the central bank’s announcement to reduce the official currency's monthly depreciation rate to 1% from 2%, starting in February, a policy known as the "crawling peg." Government data showed prices rose 2.7% in December from November, marking the third consecutive month below 3%, while annual inflation eased to 117.8%, down from a peak of nearly 300% last year. Since President Javier Milei took office in December 2023, the central bank has cut rates eight times, reducing borrowing costs from 133%. During his campaign, Milei promised to promote currency competition in South America’s second-largest economy, a plan widely known as “dollarization.”

Argentina Cuts Key Rate Further as Inflation Expectations Ease
Argentina’s central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by 300bps to 32% on December 5, 2024, as inflation expectations fell. The decision followed the release of a market expectations survey by the central bank, in which analysts reduced their inflation forecasts for the year, projecting a rate of 118.8% by year-end and reflecting confidence in the country's improving inflation outlook.  In October, the annual inflation rate in the nation was at 193%, the lowest level in eleven months, and marked the sixth successive month of easing cost pressure. Thursday's move marked the eighth rate reduction since President Javier Milei assumed office in December 2023, seen as a part of a broader strategy to support the weak economy. The South American GDP shrank by 1.7% yoy in Q2 of 2024, pointing to the fifth quarter of contraction, mainly due to declines in manufacturing production, construction, and wholesale & retail trade.
