The Central Bank of Colombia left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 9.25% in June 2025, with four directors voting to maintain, two for a 50 bps cut and one for 25 bps. Annual inflation showed a marginal decline, easing to 5.1% in May from 5.2% in April, while core inflation excluding food and regulated prices softened to 4.8% from 4.9%. Activity indicators for the first quarter suggest GDP grew 2.7% year-on-year, prompting the technical team to raise its growth forecast for 2025 to 2.7% (and to 3.0% for 2026). However, global financial conditions remain restrictive amid elevated geopolitical tensions and persistent uncertainty over U.S. tariff policy, limiting scope for more aggressive rate cuts. The Board emphasized that future policy decisions will depend on the information available.

Colombia Interest Rate
In Colombia, interest rate decisions are taken by The Central Bank of Colombia (The Banco de la República). The Banco de la República implements monetary policy by changing interest rates, which either provide or withdraw liquidity from the economy. The official interest rates are the intervention interest rates (Tasas). The Colombian Peso weakened by nearly 1% against the dollar on the news.

Colombia Holds Rate at 9.25%

Colombia Unexpectedly Cuts Rate to 9.25%
The Central Bank of Colombia reduced its benchmark policy rate by 25 bps to 9.25% in April 2025, with the Board voting unanimously for the cut. Annual inflation resumed its downward trend, easing to 5.1% in March from 5.3% in February, while core inflation excluding food and regulated prices continued to soften, falling to 4.8% from 4.9%. Activity indicators for the first quarter suggest GDP grew 2.5% year-on-year, prompting the technical team to raise its growth forecast for 2025 to 2.6% (and to 3.0% for 2026). However, external financing conditions have become more restrictive amid global trade tensions, heightened financial market volatility and a stronger dollar, bolstering Colombia’s risk premium and keeping inflationary pressures elevated, which limits scope for more aggressive rate cuts. The Board emphasized that future policy decisions will depend on incoming economic data.

Colombia Holds Rate at 9.5%
The Central Bank of Colombia kept its benchmark rate at 9.5% in March, with four directors supporting the decision and three favoring a 50bps cut. Annual inflation, after remaining stable at 5.2% for three months, increased slightly to 5.3% in February, with core inflation easing to 4.21%, driven by lower food processing and regulated prices, though service costs remained elevated at 7%. GDP expanded by 2.4% in Q4, and the ISE for January showed an annual change of 2.5%, with the technical team raising its growth forecast for 2025 from 2.6% to 2.8%. However, exchange rate volatility, stemming from tighter global financial conditions, a stronger dollar, and Colombia’s fiscal uncertainty, has raised inflationary risks, limiting room for aggressive rate cuts. The labor market continued to show strong records with rising employment and falling unemployment. The central bank emphasized that future rate decisions will depend on incoming economic data.
