The annual inflation rate in Colombia eased to 5.05% in May 2025, down from 5.16% in April and slightly below market expectations of 5.1%. This marked the lowest reading since October 2021, reflecting continued progress in curbing price pressures. The slowdown was largely driven by softer inflation in key categories such as transportation (+5.26% vs. +5.29%), housing (+5.82% vs. +6.09%), restaurants and hotels (+7.41% vs. +7.71%), and education (+7.35% vs. +7.38%). Meanwhile, inflation picked up slightly in food (+4.71% vs. +4.61%) and health (+5.34% vs. +5.31%). On a monthly basis, consumer prices rose by 0.32%, below the expected 0.5% and marking the smallest monthly increase since November, following a 0.66% rise in April.
